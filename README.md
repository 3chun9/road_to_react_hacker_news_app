# The Road to Learn React (Or at Least One of Them)

This repository aims to keep code, _i.e_ a Hacker News App, from the excellent
_[The Road to Learn React book by Robin Wieruch](https://github.com/the-road-to-learn-react/the-road-to-learn-react)_
under version control on the basis of the book's chapters and sections.

Developers new to ReactJS and reading through Wieruch's book can go through this
repository's log and checkout the state of the code at a particular commit to
track their progress on the Hacker News App.

Commit messages will specify which chapter and section the code pertains to.

Consider that the first and second commits cover everything before the
Introduction to JSX section in the first chapter, Introduction to React. _E.g._

- __Chapter 1: Introduction to React__
  - __A: Hi, My Name is React__
  - __B: Requirements__
  - __C: Installation__
  - __D: Zero-Configuration Setup__
  - E: Introduction to JSX
  - ...

This repository's code derives from the paperback version of _The Road to Learn
React_ released between late 2017 to early 2018.

## Vanilla Readme from the Tutorial Begins Here...

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
